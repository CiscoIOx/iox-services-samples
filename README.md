Samples repository

To build the samples, get the IOx services SDK comprising header files and
libraries and untar them under the root of the specific sample to build.

The Makefile under each sample assumes that SDK is copied under
sdk/include and sdk/libs before the developer tries to compile the sample.

Bundling the service as part of a LxC container, please refer to the
IOx Services documentation.

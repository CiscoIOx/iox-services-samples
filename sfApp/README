Sample Store & Forward application
===============================================================================

This is a simple docker style IOx app that installs a store & forward (SF)
policy and generates dummy data for the store & forward service.

Once the app is started, it does the following.
- Install a SF policy that reads from an NBI topic and pushes it to a mqtt sink
- Create a message topic
- Continously publish dummy data to the topic

By default, the app would install a persistent SF policy.
The sample payload for an in-memory SF policy is also included.
Please check the ./resources/ folder for the payloads.

Steps to build:

From the root folder, issue the following commands
###
sudo docker build -t sfapp .
cd package/
sudo ioxclient docker package sfapp .
###
This would generate the package.tar file which is the installable package.
